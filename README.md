## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
Some people don't have a good way to vent under the pressure of life, study and work; Some people always feel unhappy in the process of interpersonal communication; Some people are bitter about trifles. These pressures and emotions are common in most people, but in most cases they will not have a great impact on life. However, they will gradually accumulate until some people will erupt and make some extreme behaviors, or some people are unconsciously affected by this negative state.


Our product is aimed to solve the phenomenon of people suffering psychology problems but not willing to see a psychologist. Most of them are young students or employees who are under pressure and are always troubled by anxiety. However, They are reluctant to seek medical treatment because they are afraid that their psychological problems will become gossip of others, or they simply can not afford the high cost of consultation. In this situation, our online system can help. 


Our chatbot is trained with mental diagnosis samples and can lead users to share their feelings.  We also have professional psychological scales, which are similar to those in psychological clients. According to the user's performance, we can make a preliminary diagnosis, give corresponding suggestions and recommend corresponding articles. At the same time, we can absolutely ensure the privacy and security of users. Except for a user's data table that can be viewed only with the highest permission, the rest are replaced by user ID. Even the administrator can only know the corresponding user ID instead of the real name.
